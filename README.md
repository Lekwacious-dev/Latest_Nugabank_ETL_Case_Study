🔧 Tech Stack & What I Achieved On this project

✅ Python – Used for data extraction, transformation, and business logic, enabling flexible and efficient data processing.

 ✅ SQL – Leveraged for querying, validating, and structuring large datasets with accuracy and performance in mind.

 ✅ Azure Data Lake Gen2 – Implemented as a scalable, secure storage layer to support structured and semi-structured data.

 ✅ GitHub – Used for version control, collaboration, and maintaining clean, trackable code changes.

 ✅ Windows Task Scheduler – Automated the entire ETL workflow, ensuring data pipelines run reliably at scheduled intervals without manual intervention.

This project strengthened my understanding of:

Building production-grade ETL pipelines

Managing data flow from ingestion to storage

Automating workflows for consistency and reliability

Applying engineering best practices in real-world scenarios

I’m excited to keep building scalable data solutions and exploring more around data platforms, distributed processing, and cloud-based architectures.
